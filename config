# All plugins listed below will be searched for automatically, bypassing the confirmation prompt. Remove any plugin you
# do not want registered in the search.
# Plugin names are case sensitive. Each plugin must be on its own line. ADCore does not need to be included. If a version
# is not included, the script will try to detect it. If it can not detect it, it will prompt you to enter the version.
# Because the script searches your local directory to confirm the existence of a plugin, putting plugins here that aren't
# locally available will not cause any issues. An invalid plugin name will be ignored.

# The plugin version here will be used by the script, regardless of whether it is accurate to the local repository.
